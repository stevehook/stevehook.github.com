## Background

Pry is a great replacement for irb and is very useful if you ever need
to do any debugging. It does a lot. It's sometimes hard to remember all
the things it does especially when you don't create bugs that often.

## Basics

### Setting up Pry and using it as the Rails console

### Set a breakpoint

    require 'pry'; binding.pry;

Run the program and it will stop with a prompt when it hits the
breakpoint. From here you can do everything that `irb` does and more.

### Getting help

Pry has many commands that work like command line programs rather than
Ruby methods. To get started and list the commands that are available in
Pry and any installed plug-ins:

    pry> help

or use the `--help` option to get detailed help on any command:

    pry> ls --help

### Exiting Pry

If you want to just continue running your program from a breakpoint:

    pry> exit

This will only run until the next breakpoint so if you are stuck in a
loop and you really want to just stop the program you need:

    pry> exit-program

or

    pry> !!!

### Lost?
To get back to the code view

    pry> whereami

or

    pry> @

Sometimes you don't see enough code, you can specify the line count
either side of the breakpoint:

    pry> @ 10

### Call stack?
You need to include `pry-backtrace` in your Gemfile, then it's:

    pry> 


### Threads?

If you are trying to debug a multi-threaded program like Puma it can be
painful.
