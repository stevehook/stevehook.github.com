## Background

Pry is a great replacement for irb and is very useful if you ever need
to do any debugging. It does a lot. It's sometimes hard to remember all
the things it does especially when you don't create bugs that often.



## Basics

### Set a breakpoint

    require 'pry'; binding.pry;

### Lost?
To get back to the code view

    pry> whereami

or
    pry> @

Sometimes you don't see enough code, you can specify the line count
either side of the breakpoint:

    pry> @ 10

### Call stack?
You need to include `pry-backtrace` in your Gemfile, then it's:

    pry> whereami
