## Background

Coming from a Ruby or JavaScript background to Elixir there are quite a
few new things to learn. One of the more mundane topics is the
difference in built-in collection types. If you are used to having a
choice between arrays and hashes (or objects in JavaScript) then the
commonly used collections in Elixir can be confusing at first. It's a
good idea to get on top of this topic though because these collections
are everywhere. You need to know what they are meant for and how to
manipulate them.


## Why do you need more than two collection types?

Each collection type in Elixir has it's own raison d'etre.
