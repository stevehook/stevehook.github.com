## Background

Editors come and go and some very nice ones have come out recently. I've
been trying to work out why I stick with Vim.  Am I too lazy to learn a
new editor? Why don't I give Atom, Sublime or VS Code a more serious
try?

## History

I used to be a full-time IDE user, Visual Studio mostly and I dabbled
with Eclipse too.

But for the past 6 years I've stuck with Vim. More specifically I've
used Vim in a command-line terminal for 6 years.

## Why?

There are lots of reasons why I like Vim. I do like the modal editing
experience and I feel good about the editing superpowers it gives me
(though if I'm honest I *still* feel like a novice user and expect to be
still learning to use it *properly* for years to come). But the main
reason I like it is simply that it's a command-line editor.

All the 'modern' editors are GUI applications. For me that means that
they live in their own world, cut off (to some degree) from the other
programs I use to get my job done. There are some amazing plug-ins in
modern editors to integrate most, perhaps all, of the other programs I
need. However this doesn't quite work for me.

I like to work in a command line terminal, it just feels right to me. I
know a lot of developers, I respect, who use GUI applications for most
of their dev tools and are very productive doing so. Do whatever works
for you.

I don't like IDEs much. I know it's a trade-off but I prefer to have
tools that do one job well. Having source control integrated into the
program I use to edit text files is just mixing things up too much for
me. This is important to me because I like the feel of lightweight
tools, I can open any file (or directory) pretty much instantly in my
editor, with an IDE I have to wait a few seconds and I have a very short
attention span.

I think IDE bloat and the *I'm not using it if it doesn't integrate with
my IDE* mentality was what finally turned me away from .NET development
as much as a desire to work with a new programming language.  It led to
an over-dependence on tool vendor to give you access to the right tools.
Modern code editors are not so bad as Visual Studio in this respect but
there are too many reminders for me!

Anyway this is all a bit woolly and subjective, here are some more
concrete examples of why a command-line editor works for me:
