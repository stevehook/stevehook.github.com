As part of the 'remedial Unix' series lets take a look at command
line tools for finding files by name.

##find
`find` is the basic tool for file searches. The basic idea is that you
give it a starting directory some kind of search criteria and it will
print out all the matching files in that directory and any of its
sub-directories.

###Find a file when you know it's full name
To find all files with name `engine.rb`:

    $ find / -name engine.rb

This is going to be slow because we are scanning all files under `/`
so...

###Search within a certain directory
To find all files with name `engine.rb` in the `~/code` directory or any
of its sub-directories:

    $ find ~/code -name engine.rb

###Find a file when you know part of it's name
You can use wildcards:

    $ find ~/code -name '*.js'

The `*` character needs to be quoted or you can escape it with a
backslash:

    $ find ~/code -name \*.js

###Find files in a certain path
Suppose you want to find CoffeeScript files in a models directory:

    $ find ~/code -path \*/models/\* -name \*.coffee

###Find a directory
If you want to just find directories then the `type` option lets you
specify that:

    $ find ~/code -type d -name models

###Find files that changed recently
The `mtime` option is handy for list files that have changed in the past
*n* days, for example to find Ruby files that changed in the past 3
days:

    $ find ~/code -name \*.rb -mtime -3

###Find large files
Finally if you need to find out what is gobbling up all your storage
space there is the `size` option:

    $ find ~/code -size +1MB
