## Background

Your definition of what constitutes Artificial Intelligence depends a
lot on perspective. You could say it's the stuff that nobody has worked
out how to do *yet*. There are a lot of terms in the machine learning
space with more formal definitions and I'm trying to keep track of a few
here.


## Glossary

* Machine learning -
* Feature vector -
* Cost function -
* Model
* Supervised versus Unsupervised learning -
* Training, testing, validation -
* Classification -
* Regression -


## Notes

Lots of maths involved in machine learning/neural networks. Linear
algebra is hard (and fairly boring).
Neural networks boil down to matrix multiplication, which is very
tedious to code by hand.
Still trying to work out what we can do with our data that really pushes
the boundaries. I think suggested outfits or items could be done with
a neural network, whether the results are good enough remains to be seen
and I'm not sure how we start mapping the problem to an input layer?
Going to try to do a simple classifier for now - I can't get my head
around a full-on neural network in an afternoon.
