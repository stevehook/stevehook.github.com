## Running a script file
                                                                                                                                                                            Three things to remember. First a script file needs to be executable to be
runnable. If your script isn't already executable you'll need something like:

Second unless the current directory is in your current path you will need
to prefix it with `./` to run it:

    $ ./my-script

Thirdly so that the shell knows what kind of script it is you need to                                                                                                       declare this with:

## Syntax                                                                                                                                                                   ### Variables
