More remedial Unix command line.

##Zip

For a single file it's just:

    $ zip archive.zip file_to_archive

More than one file?:

    $ zip archive.zip file_to_archive another_file_to_archive

To zip a set of files in a given directory:

    $ zip folder.zip folder/*

What if it's a big nested tree of directories and files?

    $ zip folder.zip folder/**/*

##Unzip

To just look at the context of the zip file just use the `-l` option:

    $ unzip -l archive.zip

To go ahead and unzip the whole archive to the current directory it's just:

    $ unzip archive.zip

To unzip the whole archive into a different directory (creating it if
necessary):

    $ unzip archive.zip -d somewhere_else
