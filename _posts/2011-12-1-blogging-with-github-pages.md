###Why?

I finally got around to setting up this site on Github using Github
pages and Jekyll. The process couldn't be much simpler and is perfect
for me because I can write posts locally in a text editor in Markdown
format, get them right locally and then push them up to Github to
publish.

Jekyll does just enough to get a blog up and running without imposing
any unecessary style templates, so I can keep the design minimal (in
line with my minimal design capabilities).

At the moment this is still very much work in progress but it serves the
main purpose of a blog for me, being a place to store things I have
learnt to prop up my own memory.

###How to get started?
